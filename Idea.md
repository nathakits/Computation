To explore new ways to tell stories and narrate them to the user. 
Possibilities of that is to create seamless storylines that can be controlled by users eyes movement.
Immersive storytelling
Focus and rendering

* New grammar of storyleiing required
     - social cues
     - sound
* Multiple timelines/outcomes depending on the user subconscious gaze
* Gaxe duration and area can trigger certain elements in the story
* Or even multiple gazes from 1 user or many user can triger certain elements in the story
